# **Crowdsale_Smart_Contracts**

This purpose of this project is to create a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that will be minted by using a Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract that you create will manage the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. Your contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

## **Technologies**

This program is written in Solidity using Remix IDE.  

To run this you will need to open the KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol file in Remix.etherium.org which will lead to a Remix IDE screen.  

You can open the KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol file in that system to buy tokens and crowdsale.
